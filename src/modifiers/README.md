# Modifiers

Solidity modifier contracts that provide reusable access control and validation logic. These modifiers ensure proper authorization, whitelist enforcement, and function availability controls:

- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for different administrative functions
- **Whitelist Management**: Enforcement of whitelist requirements for certain operations
- **Function Control**: Ability to disable specific functions for emergency situations
